# NEBULA Architect

A revolutionary multimodal AI system that transforms spoken narrative descriptions into immersive 3D worlds with interactive elements, dynamic lighting, and physically accurate simulations—all generated in real-time while maintaining coherent narrative structure and aesthetic harmony.

## Features

- **Voice-to-World Generation**: Convert natural language descriptions into explorable 3D environments with consistent physics and aesthetics in under 30 seconds
- **Multi-Agent Simulation**: AI characters with emergent social behaviors and contextual responses
- **Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) Integration**: Photorealistic rendering of complex natural elements
- **Interactive Narrative Engine**: Real-time world adaptation based on user actions
- **Cross-Modal Style Transfer**: Influence visual aesthetics through various media inputs

## System Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- CUDA-capable GPU (NVIDIA recommended)
- 16GB+ RAM
- 50GB+ free disk space

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omdeepb69/nebula-architect.git
cd nebula-architect
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

1. Start the main application:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

2. Use voice commands to generate and interact with 3D worlds:
```bash
"Create a medieval castle on a hill with a moat and drawbridge"
```
